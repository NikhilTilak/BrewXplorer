## Data source:
All Brewery data was scraped from Wikipedia and cleaned using python. This required liberal use of regular expressions and pandas. The latitude and longitudes of the breweries were scraped from [geonames](http://www.geonames.org/).

The app was built using Dash/Plotly and deployed on Heroku.
